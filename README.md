# Machine Learning Report for House Price Prediction Competition

## Introduction
This repository is focused on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to participate in the Kaggle House Price Prediction competition by experimenting with different models, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameter tuning strategies.

The project involves exploring various algorithms to predict house prices based on a dataset containing features related to housing characteristics, location, and other relevant factors. This report focuses on the machine learning aspects of the repository, including the models used, the rationale behind their selection, and the results obtained.

## Machine Learning Approach

### Models Used
The following machine learning models were implemented in this project:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple model that predicts a relationship between features and the target variable using a straight line.
2. **Bayesian Ridge Regression**: An extension of linear regression that uses Bayesian inference to estimate coefficients, providing better performance on datasets with multicollinearity or noise.
3. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**: A non-linear regression model based on support vector machines, effective in high-dimensional spaces and for complex data relationships.
4. **Decision Tree Regressor**: A tree-based model that makes predictions by splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values. It is easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.
5. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions, reducing variance and improving generalization.
6. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: A boosting algorithm that sequentially improves predictions by fitting new models to the errors of previous ones.
7. **XGBoost Regressor**: An efficient implementation of gradient boosting designed for large datasets, known for its speed and performance.
8. **Stacked Regressor**: An ensemble method that combines multiple base regressors (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Regression) and uses a meta-learner to make final predictions.

### Rationale Behind Model Selection
1. **Linear Models (Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge)**: These serve as baseline models due to their simplicity and interpretability. They help establish a benchmark for comparison with more complex models.
2. **Tree-Based Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)**: These are chosen for their ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions in the data.
3. **Ensemble Methods (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)**: These are state-of-the-art models known for high performance on tabular datasets. They are particularly effective when features have complex, non-linear relationships with the target variable.
4. **Stacked Regressor**: This serves as a meta-model that combines predictions from multiple base models to potentially improve performance.

## Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric used in this project is the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** applied to the logarithm of predicted and actual sale prices:

$$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \log(\hat{y_i}) - \log(y_i) \right)^2}$$

- **Why RMSE?**
  - It measures the average magnitude of error, penalizing larger deviations more heavily.
  - Taking the logarithm ensures that proportional differences are considered, which is relevant for sale price prediction where data spans multiple orders of magnitude.

## Model Selection and Evaluation
The project uses 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance. This approach helps estimate how well each model generalizes to unseen data by training and testing on different subsets of the dataset.

### Key Findings:
- **XGBoost Regressor** showed the best performance among all models, likely due to its ability to handle complex relationships in the data and scale efficiently.
- The **Stacked Regressor** also performed well, leveraging the strengths of multiple base models.
- Linear models (Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge) served as useful baselines but performed less favorably compared to tree-based and ensemble methods.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, hyperparameters were tuned using **Randomized Search**, which is more efficient than grid search for large parameter spaces. The key parameters tuned include:
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the ensemble.
- `learning_rate`: Step size during training (for boosting methods).
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of trees (to prevent overfitting).
- `reg_lambda`: Regularization strength (to control model complexity).

## Results
### Top Performing Models:
1. **XGBoost Regressor**: Best performance due to its efficient handling of structured data and scalability.
2. **Stacked Regressor**: Second-best performance, leveraging multiple base models.

### Baseline Performance:
- Linear models like **Linear Regression** and **Bayesian Ridge** served as useful benchmarks but performed less favorably compared to tree-based and ensemble methods.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning approaches for house price prediction. The results highlight that **XGBoost Regressor** is particularly well-suited for this task, while stacked models also show promise by combining multiple base learners.

### Future Directions:
1. Explore advanced tree-based models like CatBoost or LightGBM.
2. Implement hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization or automated tools like Optuna.
3. Experiment with more sophisticated feature engineering techniques (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms).
4. Try ensemble methods that combine multiple XGBoost models (e.g., stacking, blending).
